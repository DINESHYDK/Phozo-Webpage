## Usage Guide

### Maintaining the Gallery

To add new items to the gallery:

1. Add a new HTML element to the gallery grid in `gallery.html`:
   ```html
   <div class="gallery-item [category-classes]" data-aos="fade-up">
     <!-- [Product Type] Product Image -->
     <img src="images/your-image.jpg" alt="Product Name" />
     <div class="gallery-overlay">
       <div class="gallery-info">
         <h3>Product Name</h3>
         <p>Product Description</p>
         <span class="price">$XX.XX</span>
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```

2. Replace `[category-classes]` with appropriate categories (e.g., `albums wedding`)
3. Add a descriptive comment above the image tag
4. Use appropriate alt text for accessibility
5. Update the product details (name, description, price)

### Modifying Themes

To modify the theme colors:

1. Open `css/style.css`
2. Locate the `:root` and `[data-theme="dark"]` sections
